## Getting up and running via Docker 
 
To get the application running locally, verify docker and docker-compose are installed, and then run ...

```
git clone https://github.com/chicommons/maps.git
cd maps
docker-compose up
```

Visit http://localhost:3001/ to see the application.
 
## Local setup (without Docker)

If you want to get things running locally without using Docker, you must install

- PostGres 10.0
- Python 3.9
- Node 12 or above

### PostGres

After installing PostGres, we may need to make some configurations.  Specifically, we need to enable login to happen without having a user with the same name defined on your system.  To do this, look for the "pg_hba.conf" file (on Mac, this is usually found at /usr/local/var/postgresql@10.0/pg_hba.conf).  Near the bottom of the file, you will want to add these lines ...
 
```
# Login for chicommons application
local   all             chicommons                              md5
```

Then restart PostGres.

### Python/Django app 

You must add the following environment variables.  On Mac or Linux, you will want to open your ~/.profile file and add

```
export DB_NAME=directory_data
export DB_USER=chicommons
export DB_PASS=password
export DB_SERVICE=localhost
# This should be the port where your PostGres DB is running
export DB_PORT=5432
```

to the end of your file.  Adjust the above settings if you have different settings.  After exiting, run

```
source ~/.profile
```

to set the environment variables in your current shell.  You can then run

```
cd web/scripts
./install_local.sh
```

to create a virtual enviroonment, install the application, and create and seed the database.  The script will prompt you for your root Postgres password so that it can create the database.

### Run the Python app

To start the Python app, run the following

```
cd web
. venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver
```

This starts the Python app on port 8000 (http://localhost:8000).  

### React app

To run the React app, run the following

```
cd client
npm install --force -g yarn
npm run start
```

This will start the React application on port 3000.  If you also have the Python app running locally, you should be able to visit http://localhost:3000 and see the start page.
